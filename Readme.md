# Slumping regime in lock-release turbidity currents: Bottom slope and particle settling

This repository contains the presentation given at the Euromech608: Dynamics of gravity currents at Grenoble (France) the 20/06/2023 by myself (C. Gadal).

It can be found online [here](https://cgadal.github.io/Talk_Euromech608_gravitycurrents/talk.html#/title-slide). 

It briefly presents results of the PALAGRAM french ANR on turbidity currents. Some of them are already published in:

- Schneider, J., Dossmann, Y., Farges, O., Régnier, M., & Kiesgen de Richter, S. (2023). Investigation of particle laden gravity currents using the light attenuation technique. Experiments in Fluids, 64(2), 23.
- Gadal, C., Mercier, M., Rastello, M., & Lacaze, L. (2023). Slumping regime in lock-release turbidity currents. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 974, A4.
